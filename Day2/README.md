## Practice üìù

The first assignment is to create an identical list of elements under the element with the id `winning-moves`. It must be the appropriate winning moves relative to the original list (scissors to rock, rock to paper, paper to scissors). Consider using `if` or `switch` statements. The second statement requires you make an **arrow function** that takes an **array of options** and will select a random one to `console.log`.
