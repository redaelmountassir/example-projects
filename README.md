### HELLO WORLD! ðŸŒŽ

This repo contains all the assignments you will be working on from Monday to Wednesday, leaving Thursday as an extra day for finalization. Each assignment is required on the day it is assigned, while projects will be presented Friday. Use the knowledge gained from these assignments to help build out your project. Don't forget when using this repo that you must start first with making your own **branch** to git push and pull from. Use the naming convention `lastname-firstname`. In case you forget how to achieve this, refer to **page 30** of the [_Draft Studios Developer Handbook_](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1V5Q9pk-pYrbj6TZlB_N4fmo3l_fPquIhfZIN79DhaNA/edit#).

# NOTE:

If an unstarted assignment is causing errors preventing your other code from working, you can always temporarily comment code out to return to at a later time. All code must be running and uncommented when submitting however
