## Practice üìù

First, finish the `expression class` to work with all the types of operations. This file is contained in a `module` js file (named `module.js`) and is determined to be a module because of its use of an `export` statement and the type added in the script tag in the HTML. Import this class into your `script.js`, and use it along with the values and operation of the input elements to reveal the output as the text of the output element. The value of an HTML input element can be found in scripting by using the property `.value`.
