## Practice üìù

First, notice how the script is linked in the `index.html` file (_Feel free to add CSS to better improve the visuals_). In the first assignment, simply log to the JS console the words "Hello World!". Next, notice in the HTML there are three button elements each with their own ID. Now check the `script.js` file you will be modifying. Within the `run()` function (_this function only runs after the page loads to ensure the elements are available_) each button is saved as an element along with the header used for output.

**Your task as a developer is to detect the click of each button, and display which option was selected in the output variable**
